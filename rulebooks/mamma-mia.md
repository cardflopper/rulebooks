# Goal

Each player has orders for 8 pizzas. The player who completes the most
pizzas in 3 rounds, wins.

# Preparation

Each player takes a set of 8 order cards (with the same colored back),
shuffles the stack face down on the table; this is his personal **order
stack**.

- With **5 players**, use *all* the ingredient cards.
- With **4 players**, remove *1* of each ingredient card.
- With **3 players**, remove *3* of each ingredient card.
- With **2 players**, remove *5* of each ingredient card.

Place the removed cards in the box.

Shuffle the ingredient cards together with the Mamma Mia! Card and
deal 6 to each player face down. Place the remaining ingredient cards
face down on the table as the *common* **ingredient stack**. Each player
takes the top card from his personal order stack and adds it to his the
ingredient cards in his hand.

# Play

## Playing Order

On a player's turn he does the following in the order shown:

-   he *must* take 1 or more ingredient cards from his hand & place it
    face-up on the pizza stack
-   he may take 1 order card from his hand & place it face-up on the
    pizza stack
-   he *must* draw cards to fill his hand to 7 cards

## Playing Explanation

The hungriest player begins. The others take their turns in clockwise
order.

The **pizza stack** is a face up stack of ingredient and order cards in
the center of the table begun by the starting player. The player may
play as many ingredient cards as he wants (at least 1), but they must
all be the same ingredient.

He may take 1 of the orders in his hand & place it face up on the pizza
stack.

The player draws cards to fill his hand to 7 cards. He may draw cards
from either the ingredient stack *or* from his order stack, but *not
both* in the same turn. If the deck he draws from does not have enough
cards, the player will have fewer than seven cards in his hand for a
short time.


### Drawing Card Example

On his turn, Alberto (green player) takes 3 salamis from his hand,
places them on top of the pizza stack and announces "3 salamis". He then
puts an order for 4 salamis and 1 pepper on the stack. Although his
personal order stack has only 3 cards, he draws these 3 cards and, thus,
plays with 6 cards in his hand.

The drawing and playing of cards ends when the last card is drawn from
the ingredient stack.

## Mamma Mia! Card & Responsibilities

When a player is dealt or draws the Mamma Mia! card, he immediately
places it face up on the table near his personal order stack and is
immediately dealt or draws another ingredient card to replace it.

When the common ingredient stack is depleted, the pizza stack is
examined for correctly filled orders. The player with the Mamma Mia! is
"Mamma Mia" for this round and begins by turning the pizza stack
up-side-down. Mamma Mia then draws cards from the pizza stack 1 at a
time (in the order they were played) and places them face up in separate
piles for each ingredient. When she draws an order, she examines the
face up ingredient piles to see if there are sufficient ingredients to
fill the order. If there are, she removes these ingredients from the
piles and places them face up on top of the Mamma Mia card. If there are
not sufficient ingredients to fill the order, the player who played the
order (they are color-coded), may add ingredients from his hand to
complete the order. In this case, she takes cards from the ingredient
piles and from the player and places them on top of the Mamma Mia card.

If an order cannot be filled, she returns the order card to the player
and he places the order face down under his order stack. The order stack
is not shuffled. Mamma Mia removes no ingredients from the piles.


### Completion Of An Order Example

The following ingredients are available in the face up piles.

-   1 pepper
-   2 salami
-   3 pineapple
-   4 mushroom

Mamma Mia draws Alberto's order for 4 pineapple and 1 pepper. The order
cannot be filled completely from the face up piles; 1 pineapple is
missing. Alberto gives Mamma Mia 1 pineapple from his hand and the order
is completed. Mamma Mia puts the 5 cards (4 pineapple and 1 pepper) on
top of the Mamma Mia card and places the order card in the box, removing
it from the game: it has been filled. All other cards remain untouched
and Mamma Mia continues with her examination of the pizza stack.

When Mamma Mia has examined all cards in the pizza stack, the round
ends.

The face up ingredient piles remain until the end of the next round when
Mamma Mia will add to their numbers during her examination of the pizza
stack. Thus, the ingredients in these piles will be available for orders
placed in the next round. Mamma Mia shuffles the cards that were placed
on top of the Mamma Mia! card (including the Mamma Mia! card) and places
them face down as the common ingredient stack.

## Beginning Next Round

Mamma Mia begins the next round by taking her first turn. Some players
may have fewer than 7 cards at the beginning of rounds 2 and 3 as they
may have used some of their cards to complete orders. If a player has no
ingredient cards in such a case, he takes his normal turn, but without
playing any ingredient cards.

# The Order Cards

5 of the eight order cards display specific ingredients needed. To fill
these orders, the ingredients shown must be available in the face up
ingredient piles and/or in the player's hand. There are 3 special
pizzas, described below.

## Pizza Bombastica

To fill this order, you need 15 or more ingredients of any kind. As with
other orders, the player who played it may add ingredients from his
hand. If the total number of ingredients available (including any added
by the player) is less than 15, the order cannot be filled. When the
order is filled, all ingredients in the face up piles are used (placed
on the Mamma Mia card), even if this is more than 15. Thus, after a
Bombastica order is filled, the ingredient piles are empty.

## Pizza Monotoni

To fill this order, you need 1 of the specific ingredients shown on the
card and exactly 6 of any other single ingredient. It may not be filled
using 7 of the specific ingredient.

## Pizza Minimale

To fill this order, you need 1 of the specific ingredients shown on the
card and exactly 3 of the ingredients with the fewest cards in the face
up ingredient piles. It may not be the ingredient pictured as the
specific ingredient on the card. If there are several ingredients tied
for fewest, the player who placed the order (the order cards are
color-coded) decides which to use. An ingredient with no cards in the
face up ingredient piles may not be selected.

### Pizza Minimale Example

The following ingredients are available in the face up piles.

-   2 salamis
-   2 mushrooms
-   2 peppers
-   3 pineapples

Mamma Mia draws Alberto's (green) Pizza Minimale. Salami, mushroom and
pepper are all tied with fewest at 2 each (olive has none and cannot be
selected). The order shows pepper as the specific ingredient (matching
Alberto's color, which is green). Thus, Alberto may select between
salami and mushroom. As there are not 3 of either, he must add 1 from
his hand of whichever he chooses to complete the order.

# Game End

The game ends after three rounds.

The player who filled the most orders (got rid of the most order cards)
is the winner. If there is a tie, the player with the most ingredient
cards in his hand wins.
