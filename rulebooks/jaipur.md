# Introduction and aim of the game

Jaipur... You are hoping to become the Maharaja’s personal trader by being richer than your opponent at the end of each week (round). To do so, collect and exchange goods (cards) at the market, then sell them for rupees (on the back of the tokens). If you manage to put together a really good deal (three cards or more), then you’ll receive a reward (bonus token). As for the camels, they are mainly used for exchanges when you want to take multiple goods at the market.

**At the end of each round, the richer trader receives a Seal of
Excellence. The first player to collect 2 of these wins the game.**

- The players then remove any camels from their hands and put them face up in a in a stack in front of them. This forms each player’s herd.
- Sort the tokens by goods type.
- Make a pile for each goods type in descending order of value.

# Game turn

On your turn, you can either *TAKE CARDS* or *SELL CARDS*. But never both!

Your turn is now over and your opponent chooses one of these actions.

## Take cards

If you take cards, you must choose one of the following options :
- A take several goods (=EXCHANGE !),
- B take 1 single good,
- C take all the camels.

### Take several goods

1. Take all the goods cards that you want into your hand (they can be of different types), then...
2. exchange the same number of cards. The returned cards can be camels, goods , or a c ombination of the two.

### Take 1 single good

1. Take a single goods card from the market into your hand, then...
2. replace it with the top card from the deck.

### Take the camels

1. Take ALL the camels from the market and add them to your herd, then...
2. replace the cards taken by drawing from the deck

**ATTENTION:** Players may never have more than 7 cards in their hand **at the end of their turn**.

## Sell cards

To sell cards, choose one type of good and discard as many cards of that type as you like onto the discard pile. Each sale earns goods tokens and, if the sale is big enough, a bonus.

A sale is carried out in 3 steps.

1. Sell as many cards as you want, placing them face up on the discard pile.
2. Take as many tokens as cards discarded (starting with the “top” of the corresponding row, that is, starting with the highest values.) Stack the tokens in front of you.
3. If you sell 3 or more cards, take the corresponding bonus token.

> NB: the value of a bonus is not known until it is drawn. For 3 cards sold , it will be 1, 2 or 3 rupees. For 4 cards sold , it will be 4, 5 or 6 rupees and for 5 cards sold , it will be 8, 9 or 10 rupees. Unlike the goods tokens, the rupee value of the bonus token is only printed on the back (hence the question marks on the front).

### Restrictions during a sale

When selling the 3 most expensive goods (diamonds, gold and silver), the sale must include a minimum of 2 cards. (This rule applies even if there is only one goods token of a given type left.)

**REMINDER:** You can only sell one goods type each round, never more.

# End of a round

A round ends immediately if:

- 3 types of goods token are depleted, OR
- There are no cards left in the draw pile when trying to fill the market.

## Scoring

- The player with the most camels in his herd receives the camel token, worth 5 rupees.
- The players turn over their tokens and add them up to determine who is the richer.
- The richer trader takes a Seal of Excellence.
- In the case of a tie, the player with the most bonus tokens takes the seal. If the players are still tied, the one with the most goods tokens takes the seal.

## New round

If neither player has 2 Seals of Excellence yet, set up the game again from the beginning and play a new round. The player who lost the previous round starts.

# End of the game

The game ends immediately as soon as one of the players has 2 Seals of Excellence. That player wins the game and is appointed as the Maharaja’s personal trader.
