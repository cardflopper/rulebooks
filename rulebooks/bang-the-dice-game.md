# Contents

- 5 Dice
- 8 Roles: 1 Sheriff, 2 Deputies, 3 Outlaws, 2 Renegade
- 16 Characters (each with a unique ability and life points)
- 6 Summary cards (explaining the dice results)
- 9 Arrow tokens - Life point “bullet” tokens (25 bullets × value 1, 15 × value 3)
- These rules

# Object of the game

Each player has his own goal, depending on his role card:

- _Sheriff_: must eliminate all Outlaws and the Renegade(s);
- _Outlaws_: must eliminate the Sheriff;
- _Deputies_: must help and protect the Sheriff;
- _Renegade_: must be the last character in play.

# Preparation

1. Take as many **roles** as the number of players, divided as follows:
    - 3 players: see special rules, ahead;
    - 4 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws;
    - 5 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws, 1 Deputy;
    - 6 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 1 Deputy;
    - 7 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies;
    - 8 players: 1 Sheriff, 2 Renegades, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies.

    Shuffle the roles and deal one, face down, to each player.
2. The **Sheriff reveals himself** by turning his card **face up**. All other
    players look at their role but must keep it **secret**.
3. Shuffle the **characters** and give one **face up** to each player. Each player
    now announces the name of his character and reads his ability aloud.
    Each character has some special abilities, which make him unique.
4. Each player takes a number of **bullets** as shown on his character
    card. The **Sheriff** plays the game with **two additional bullets**. The
    bullets you have are your **life points** —i.e., how many times you can
    be hit before being eliminated from play. Keep any remaining bullets
    in a pile in the middle of the table.
5. Keep the **summary cards** handy. You can use them when you have a
    doubt about the dice results.
6. Place the nine **arrows** in a pile in the middle of the table.
7. Put the remaining roles and characters back in the box.
8. The Sheriff takes the five **dice** and starts the game.

# The Game

The game is played in turns, in clockwise order. On your turn, you will:

- Roll all five dice
- You may then choose to keep the dice or re-roll some or all of them up to two times. If you roll a third time, you **may** also re-roll any dice you didn't choose to re-roll on your second roll. You **must** accept the third roll.
- When you are satisfied with your dice roll (or you’re out of re-rolls),
    resolve the dice results.
- Your turn is over and play passes to the player on your left.
**Important**: Any **Dynamite** rolled **cannot** be re-rolled (see below).
**Note**: Any **Arrows** rolled **must** be resolved **immediately** after each roll (see below).

> **Bullets and Arrows**
>
> Unless an ability says otherwise, when you gain a life point (bullet)
> or arrow, take it from the central pile. If you lose a life point or
> arrow, return it to the pile.
> You can exchange a three-bullet token for three one-bullet tokens
> from the supply at any time (or vice-versa).

# The Dice

The dice show six different symbols. The symbols showing on the dice each have a different effect. You must apply all the dice results in the following order. You cannot pass on a rolled die: you must use them all!

## 1. Indian arrow

You must resolve this die **immediately when rolled** , not at the end of your turn. Take one arrow token (one per arrow rolled) and keep it in front of you. You **may** roll this die again if you have re-rolls left. If you take the last arrow, the Indians attack and **each** player loses one life point for **each** arrow in front of him. After the attack, all players discard their arrows, and you resume your turn.

## 2. Dynamite

This die **cannot be re-rolled**! If you roll **three** or more Dynamites, your turn ends immediately and you lose one life point. But, all your other dice results are still resolved as normal.

## 3A. Bull's Eye “1”

Choose the player next to you on your left or right. That player loses one life point.

## 3B. Bull's Eye “2”

Choose the player exactly two places to your left or right. That player loses one life point. If there are only two or three players left in the game, treat this as [1]. **Important**: [1] and [2] results are resolved at the same time. When counting places, do not include eliminated players.

## 5. Beer

Choose any player: he gains one life point. You may choose yourself. You can **never** have more life points than the number you had at the beginning of the game. If you choose a player with his maximum life points, this result is wasted.

## 6. Gatling

If you roll three or more Gatlings you activate the Gatling Gun, and **each** of the **other** players loses one life point. Also, you discard all of your arrows.

# Running Out of Life Points—A Player Is Eliminated

If you lose your last life point, you are out of the game. Show your role to all players and discard all your arrows. If you are eliminated, you do not act in the game anymore. But, if your team partners win, you win too!

# End of the Game

The game ends immediately if:

1. The Sheriff is eliminated: If a Renegade is the only one alive, he wins. Otherwise, all Outlaws win as a team.
2. All the Outlaws and Renegades are eliminated: The Sheriff and all Deputies win as a team.

> **Note:** In an 8-player game, each of the two Renegades plays on his own, and wins only if he is the last player alive. If, in the final stages of the game, the Sheriff is confronted by two Renegades and the Sheriff is eliminated first, the Outlaws win!

> **Example:** All the Outlaws have been eliminated, but a Renegade is still in play. In this case, the game continues. The Renegade must now face the Sheriff and his Deputies on his own. Example: The Sheriff is eliminated, but all the Outlaws were already eliminated and one Deputy and a Renegade are still in play. The game ends with the Outlaws winning! They achieved their goal at the cost of their own lives!

> **Example:** All players are eliminated at the same time. Outlaws win!

# Special Rules for 3-Players

Shuffle these three roles: Deputy, Outlaw, and Renegade. Give one of them randomly to each player, but place them face up on the table. Everyone knows the role of all three players. The goal of each player is determined by his role:

- the **Deputy** must eliminate the Renegade;
- the **Renegade** must eliminate the Outlaw;
- the **Outlaw** must eliminate the Deputy.

The game plays as usual, with the Deputy taking the first turn. You win as soon as you reach your goal if **you cause your target to lose his last life point** (e.g., as the Deputy you must personally eliminate the Renegade). If the other player dealt the final hit, then the goal for both survivors is to be the last man standing. For example, if the Outlaw eliminated the Renegade, then the Deputy did not win—he must now eliminate the Outlaw, who must in turn eliminate the Deputy in order to win.
