# Summary

Drawing from a personal deck of cards, use the values on the cards to race your dog sled against other players on a modifiable snow track. Winner is the first and furthest across the finish line.

# Contents

* 16 Track Tiles
	* 1 Double-sided Start
	* 2 Double-sided U-turn
	* 8 Double-sided Straights
	* 4 Double-sided Corners
	* 1 Double-sided Finish
* 5 Wooden Sled Tokens
* 5 Sled Mats
* 5 Dog Decks
* 32 Brake Markers
* 20 Dent Cards
* 20 Wooden Saplings
* 1 "Big Paws" Token

# Game setup

* Setup track, yellow flags on left, red on right
* Each player gets a token, mat, and Dog Deck (cards, shuffled, face down) of a colour
* Brake marker "3" in each player mat
* Dent cards and brake markers available next to track
* Choose who starts, going clockwise, place sleds and draw 5 cards, plus additionals for places on track

# Game Overview

* Turns go in order of current race position, inside trumps equal positions

## Each Turn

* Play 1-3 Canine Cards of exact same value onto dogs, or discard piles, one card per location. Brake marker of card value placed
* Move sled forward by adding canine values (speed) - brake value, drift sideways (positions at player's discretion) by difference of canine values to the max of speed
* Return hand to 5 cards including dent cards (which can't be discarded), draw/discard

# Gameplay Notes

* Bonus movement is awarded to balanced sleds and given at the value of the race position, to be taken completely or not at all, in a straight line, provided player had speed, and not on first turn
* Hazards
  * Exceeding safety speed = speed - safety speed
  * Crashing into another sled stops in place, don't refill hand, just discard
  * Side of track = 1 dent card
  * 5 dent cards = dead, unless at finish

# Game End

* End of round, player over finish line and furthest wins
