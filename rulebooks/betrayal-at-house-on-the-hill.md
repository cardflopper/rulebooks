# Setup

**Choose Characters** Each player chooses a figure, its matching character card, and attaches clips to the card pointing to the green starting numbers.

**Place Decks** Shuffle the Omen, Item and Event decks.

**Place Starting Tiles** Place the Basement Landing, Entance Hall/ Foyer/Grand Staircase, and Upper Landing tiles reasonably far apart.

Shuffle the remainiing tiles into a facedown stack.

**Place all figures in the Entrance Hall.** The explorer who has the next birthday starts first, with turns proceeding clockwise.

# Order of Play

On his turn, each player may make as many of the following actions as desired, in any order:

- Move

- Discover a new room

- Attempt a die roll

- Use Items or Omen cards

- Attack (once per turn after the Haunt starts)

Before the Haunt starts, a player must make a **Haunt** roll at the end of his turn if he draws an Omen card.

# Moving

**Explorers** can move a number of spaces up to their current **Speed**. Movement ends once a card is drawn.

**Monsters** roll a number of dice equal to their Speed to find the number of spaces they may move each turn. Roll once for a group of monsters.

You can always move at least one space.

**Moving Past Opponents**

After the Haunt starts, for each opponent in a room with you, a Hero, monster or Traitor must use one extra space of movement to leave that room. _Stunned_ monsters don’t slow an explorer’s move in this way.

# Discovering a New Room

When an explorer enters a doorway without a room on the other side, look at the top tile on the room stack.

- **If it matches the floor you are on** , turn it over and connect it to the doorway and move into it.

- **If it doesn’t match your floor** , set it aside face down in a discard pile.

Doors are always open except for the front door, which is always locked.

The **Grand Staircase** always connects to the **Upper Landing**.

The **Stairs from Basement** always lead to and from the **Foyer** via a secret door which cannot be used until the Stairs from Basement room is discovered.

If a tile could only be played in such a way that a level would be sealed off with no free doorways left, discard that tile and draw new ones until you draw one that leaves a free doorway.

If the entire stack is used shuffle the discard pile; it becomes the new stack.

# Special Rooms

**Attic, Graveyard, Junk Room, Pentagram Chamber**

If an explorer fails his roll, he may choose to stay in the room and try again on his next turn instead of taking damage.

**Chapel, Gymnasium, Larder, Library**

Each player can receive the benefit from each of these rooms just once per game. Monsters cannot use these rooms.

**Coal Chute**

Entering the Chute and moving to the Basement Landing counts as one move. You can never end your turn on the Chute tile. The Chute affects Traitors and monsters.

**Collapsed Room**

Explorers after the first may ignore the room ability or use it intentionally (and take the damage). Falling to the basement doesn’t count as a move.

If the first to go down from the Collapsed Room is a monster, or if all basement rooms have been played, choose an explored basement room and put the Below Collapsed Room token there.

Traitors and Monsters can move through the Collapsed Room without damage.

**Crypt, Furnace Room**

Monsters ignore the special rules of these rooms.

**Gallery**

You can only choose to fall to the Ballroom if it is in play.

**Mystic Elevator**

You can use the Elevator only once a turn. If there isn’t a connecting door on the appropriate floor, leave the Elevator where it is. If you roll the same floor, you may move it to a different door on the same floor.

All explorers in the Elevator take damage if an explorer entering it rolls 0.

Traitors and Monsters can use the Elevator without rolling, but only once per Traitor/Monster set of turns.

**Underground Lake**

If found on the upper floor, the Lake collapses; put it and the explorer next to any door in the Basement. The original upper floor spot is now empty.

**Vault, Tower, Chasm, Catacombs**

These are all **barrier** rooms. You may attempt once per turn to make the trait roll to be able to cross the room.

You cannot interact with another explorer on the other side of the tile if you cannot cross. Crossing the barrier doesn’t count as moving a space.

Monsters ignore barriers.

If you are transported to a barrier room (eg by the Collapsed Room) you choose which side to land on. However you always land outside the Vault.

**Vault**

Once the Vault has been opened, put the Vault Empty token on it.

The Traitor must also roll to open the Vault.

# Event, Item and Omen Cards

The first time a room with a card symbol is discovered , that explorer’s movement ends. Draw a card matching the symbol and read it out loud before following any instructions in the room.

**Event card** instructions are followed and the card discarded unless it says otherwise.

**Item cards** are kept face up by the explorer; he may use it once immediately and once on each subsequent turn, unless it says otherwise.

**Omen cards** are kept face up by the explorer and any instructions followed. At the end of that turn the player must make a **Haunt** roll.

## Using Items and Omens

For each item during a turn, an explorer or monster that can carry items may only perform **one** of the following actions: use the item once, give the item to another willing explorer, drop the item, steal the item, or pick up the item.

If you drop items, put an **Item Pile** token in that room.

Some items can’t be traded, but may be dropped or picked up.

Some omens are companions that follow their custodian and cannot be dropped, picked up or traded.

The **Crystal Ball** can only be used to look through undrawn Item and Event cards.

The **Toy Monkey** can only attack once per turn.

The **Dog** can’t go through one-way passages, any passage like the Revolving Wall that requires a roll, or use the Mystic Elevator. His movement is not slowed by monsters.

The **Image in the Mirror** Omen card does not affect omens that are also items, such as the Book.

The **It is Meant to Be** only allows you to save a result for a die roll _you_ make.

Monsters can use the **Secret Stairs** , **Secret Passage** , **Revolving Wall** (no need to roll) and **Mystic Slide** to move around.

# Die Rolls

When making a roll based on your explorer’s traits, roll as many dice as your explorer _currently_ has in that trait.

You cannot try to make the same roll more than once per turn. Also, you cannot make more than one roll of a particular category specified in a scenario per turn. For example, if a haunt told you to make exorcism rolls, you could attempt to make a Knowledge roll for the room you were in, or a Sanity roll for an item you held, but not both rolls in the same turn, or rolls for two different rooms, or for two different items.

# Attacks

Once the Haunt has started, _once per turn_ explorers (including Traitors) and monsters may attack an opponent in the same room.

You can’t use a trait to attack an opponent who doesn’t also have that trait.

## Physical Damage

Generally, you and your opponent roll a number of dice equal to your **Might**. The higher result **defeats** his opponent and inflicts **physical damage** equal to the difference between the two results.

**Lower the defeated explorer’s Might and/or Speed** a total number of spaces equal to the damage.

If an attack is made with a trait other than Might, use that other trait in the same way.

If you attack someone and inflict 2 or more points of physical damage (not a distance attack), you may **steal** a tradable item instead of doing the damage.

## Distance Attacks

The Revolver allows an explorer to attack an opponent in a room that is anywhere in a line of sight leading through an uninterrupted straight line of doors. Some monsters may also attack in this way. If the target defeats the attacker he takes no damage.

## Mental Damage

When an attack is made with Sanity or Knowledge, it inflicts **mental damage**.

**Lower the defeated explorer’s Sanity and/or Knowledge** a total number of spaces equal to the damage.

## Death and Stuns

Before the Haunt starts, explorer traits can only go to their lowest number. Once the Haunt begins, if an explorer’s trait goes down to the **Skull** symbol, the explorer dies.

If an explorer dies put an Item Token in the room along with any Companion token. Any other explorer that enters the room gains custody of the companion and may pick up the items.

Monsters are only **stunned** when you defeat them, unless a Haunt specifies otherwise. Flip the monster token over; a stunned monster can’t slow an explorer’s movement, but a Traitor may still move the monster. At the end of the monster’s turn flip it back.

If a stunned monster is attacked and wins, it deals no damage.

# The Haunt

When an Omen card is drawn, roll 6 dice. If you roll less than the total number of all Omen cards that have been drawn, the **Haunt** starts. The player who rolled is called the **Haunt Revealer**.

The Haunt Revealer looks up the Haunt chart to see which Haunt has been revealed and who is the **Haunt Traitor**. Cross index the name of the Omen card and the room the Omen card was drawn from.

The Haunt Traitor takes the **Traitor’s Tome** and leaves the room to read the Haunt.

The rest of the players become **Heroes** and read the Haunt with the same number in the **Survival Guide**.

## Hero and Traitor Turns

When everyone is ready, both sides do anything the Haunt told them to in the **Right Now** section. The first turn always starts with the player to the Traitor’s left and goes clockwise. After the Traitor’s turn, any **monsters** controlled by the Traitor get a monster turn.

All players are still explorers and have the same actions, except they no longer make Haunt rolls.

Even if the Traitor dies, as long as the monsters can complete the Traitor’s goals, they still get their turn.

## Traitor and Monster Powers

When you become a traitor, prior lingering bad effects from Event cards disappear.

Traitors and monsters can use any beneficial text on a room tile (such as the movement from the Collapsed Room or the Gallery) while ignoring any harmful text (any damage from these two rooms, or from the Furnace Room, the Crypt, and the Junk Room, or the turn-ending text on the Chasm and the Tower).

The Traitor can choose not to be affected by an Event card or Omens such as Bite.

Monsters, but not traitors, are able to climb up the Coal Chute, Collapsed Room, and Gallery without making a roll.

Monsters can’t explore new rooms or carry items unless the Haunt says otherwise. If a monster allowed to carry items is stunned, he drops all items (put an Item Pile token in the room). It can’t pick them up until it has an active turn.

If there is no possible way for a monster to reach heroes on another floor, the Traitor may on his turn go through the Room stack until he finds the Stairs from Basement tile and put it into play next to any open basement doorway.

# Haunt Scenarios

If a scenario states that something must be done a number of times equal to the number of explorers, this includes those who get killed.

The heroes should not tell the Traitor what their goals are unless it is necessary. You should announce the purpose of any action you are taking to the other side but don’t need to reveal what number you need to roll.

# Winning the Game

The first side (Traitor or Heroes) that completes its goals for the Haunt wins the game. At least one hero must survive for the heroes to win.

When a side wins, that side reads the **If You Win** section from that side’s Haunt out loud.
